## Overview
I aim to answer the question: _How do geographical disparities in policing relate to racial disparities in prosecution?_ While there exist many papers covering racial disparities in policing and racial disparities in prosecution, I hope to identify the relationship between the two stages within the criminal justice system so as to better inform criminal justice reform policy. Iâ€™ll focus on Orange County as a case study, with possible extensions to San Francisco and Contra Costa Counties, depending on data availability from the ACLU.

This repository is for Lauren Chu's Data Science Honors Thesis, Class of Spring 2026 at UC Berkeley. It includes all the code and data involved in the research, which is taking place during the 2025-26 academic school year. 

## Advisor
I am advised by Professor Joshua Grossman.
